• Payment Status Tracking

o Customers receive instant confirmation for successful payments.

o If a payment fails, they should have an option to retry or switch payment 

methods.

II. SYSTEM FEATURES

These define specific characteristics of the system:

1. Frontend Features

The frontend serves as the primary interface for customers, restaurants, and delivery agents.

User-Friendly UI

• The interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate, ensuring smooth order placement 

and menu browsing.

• A dashboard system should provide quick access to order history, profile settings, and 

saved payment methods.

Mobile-Responsive Design

• The system should adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

• Implement progressive web app (PWA) features for a fast-loading experience on 

mobile devices.

Real-Time Order Tracking

• Customers should receive live updates about order status changes (Pending → Preparing 

→ Out for Delivery → Delivered).

• Display an interactive map for tracking delivery agents’ movements in real-time.

2. Backend Features

The backend handles business logic, user roles, and secure transactions.

REST API-Based Architecture

• A modular REST API enables clear communication between frontend and backend 

services.

• The API must follow RESTful principles, ensuring structured endpoints (/orders, 

/customers, /payments).

Role-Based Access

• Users should have different privileges based on their roles:

o Customers: Browse menus, place orders, track deliveries.

o Restaurant Owners: Manage menus, accept or reject orders.

o Delivery Agents: View assigned deliveries, update delivery status.

Authentication & Authorization

• Implement OAuth2 or JWT-based authentication to manage secure access.

• Ensure secure session management, preventing unauthorized users from accessing 

sensitive data.

3. Database Features

A structured relational database ensures efficient storage and retrieval of data.

Relational Database Structure

• Utilize MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server for structured data management.

• Maintain well-defined tables for customers, orders, payments, and deliveries with unique 

identifiers.

Data Indexing for Fast Retrieval

• Implement indexing on critical fields (e.g., OrderID, CustomerID) to improve query 

performance.

• Optimize queries using stored procedures or caching mechanisms.

Audit Logging

• Maintain an audit trail of major system events (user logins, order modifications, 

payments).

• Store logs securely for compliance and debugging purposes.

4. Performance & Scalability

The system should efficiently handle large amounts of data and user traffic.

Order Processing Capacity

• Must support 100+ order transactions per minute, ensuring no delays.

• Implement asynchronous processing for background tasks (e.g., sending notifications).

Scalability for High Traffic

• Design the architecture to handle thousands of concurrent users.

• Utilize load balancing techniques to distribute incoming requests across multiple 

servers.

5. Security

Strong security measures ensure user data remains protected.

Encryption for Sensitive Data

• Encrypt user passwords, payment details, and personal information using AES-256 or 

SHA encryption techniques.

• Ensure SSL/TLS protocols are in place for secure communication.

Secure API Access

• Enforce role-based authentication so only authorized users can access system 

functionalities.

• Implement rate limiting and API throttling to prevent abuse.

III. IDENTIFIED CONSTRAINTS

These constraints define the technical, integration, and operational limitations for the system, 

ensuring compliance with project requirements and feasibility.

1. Technology Constraints

Frontend Technology (Angular)

• The system will exclusively use Angular for the frontend, restricting compatibility with 

other frameworks like React or Vue.js..

• All UI components and frontend logic must be built using Angular Material, ensuring 

consistency.

• Developers must follow Angular best practices for modular component structures, state 

management, and API interactions.

Backend Technology (Spring Boot)

• The backend is limited to Java (Spring Boot), meaning integration with .NET or Node.js 

is not supported.

• Business logic and services must adhere to Spring Boot architecture principles, 

including Dependency Injection and RESTful API standards.

• Asynchronous processing will be managed via Spring Boot Async or Kafka, restricting 

external queuing mechanisms like RabbitMQ.

Database Compatibility

• The system will rely on relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server).

• No support for NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Firebase, Cassandra) in the first release.

• Structured Query Language (SQL) must be optimized for efficient indexing and 

retrieval.

2. Integration Constraints

The system has limited support for third-party services to prioritize security and control over 

transactions.

Restricted Third-Party Integrations

• No external service integrations (such as third-party restaurant APIs, loyalty reward 

programs, or external order fulfillment systems).

• Only payment gateway integrations (Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay) are permitted.

• Must ensure compliance with financial security protocols like PCI-DSS for payment 

processing.

Limited External API Calls

• The backend will restrict outbound API calls except for payment transactions, reducing 

dependency on third-party APIs.

• Any data exchange with external systems must undergo strict authentication checks, 

preventing unauthorized access.

• The system must rely on local database lookups instead of external APIs for 

performance reasons.

Internal API Management

• All internal microservices will communicate via REST API—GraphQL or WebSocketbased communication is not supported.

• APIs must follow strict rate-limiting policies to prevent abuse and ensure performance.

3. Operational Constraints

System deployment and processing capabilities are constrained by initial development 

limitations.

Local Development Environment

• The first release will be deployed locally, restricting cloud hosting or multi-server 

architecture.

• No support for containerized deployment (Docker/Kubernetes) until further 

optimizations.

• Developers must manually configure database connections and API endpoints, as no 

cloud-based auto-scaling is provided.

Order Processing Performance

• The system must handle high-speed order processing, ensuring quick response times.

• Implement thread management and request prioritization to reduce performance 

bottlenecks.

• Orders must be processed asynchronously to avoid delays due to multiple concurrent 

requests.

Scalability Limitations

• No dynamic scaling in the first release—fixed server and memory allocation.

• Performance optimization must focus on code efficiency, caching strategies, and SQL 

indexing.

• The system must ensure consistent response times, even under peak load
